# F1 TV RSS feed

![](./assets/atom-valid.png)

I've been waiting for RSS feed from F1 TV for a while, and after months of waiting I've decided that enough is enough. I need to do something about, it can't continue this way. I'm missing too much good stuff from F1 TV, because there's no easy way to know if there's anything new on F1 TV.

So, here comes this link for F1 TV unofficial RSS feed: https://f1tv-rss.vercel.app/api/rss

Just add this feed to your favourite RSS reader, and it should just work.

Cheers!
